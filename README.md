# Master-s-Project

*   Regression is one of the most important and broadly used machine learning and statistics tools out there. It allows us to make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features of the data and some observed, continuous-valued response. 

*   Regression is used in a massive number of applications ranging from predicting stock prices to understanding gene regulatory networks. 

*   In this project, I applied different models to predict the prices of hotels
and compared how good the models are by calculating the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of those models.
